# Product Requirements Document: Location-Based Content Platform

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for a new location-based services platform, enabling users to upload and view content tied to specific geographic locations. The platform aims to solve a hidden need for localized content discovery and notification, serving both consumers and businesses. **It will be delivered primarily as a Progressive Web App (PWA)**, featuring a dark theme with vibrant colors and integrating with Mapbox for map display.

## 2. Goals
*   Provide a universal platform for browsing and getting notified about local content for consumers and businesses.
*   Enable users to upload content (videos, images, text) associated with their current location.
*   Allow users to discover and view content uploaded by others based on their location or a specified area.
*   Implement a mandatory 1-5 star voting system to ensure content quality and relevance.
*   Provide a visually appealing user interface with a dark theme and vibrant color accents.
*   Implement geofencing capabilities with triggers for location-specific interactions.
*   Integrate push notifications, email, and SMS for relevant updates and interactions.
*   Facilitate location-based advertising for businesses, tailored to consumer preferences.

## 3. User Stories (High-Level Examples)
*   **Consumer Use Cases:**
    *   As a radio amateur, I want to get a notification when I am in a certain range of another amateur, so I can connect with them.
    *   As a user, I want to find second-hand items (e.g., a dishwasher) via geofenced ads, so I can acquire goods locally.
    *   As a traveler, I want to discover great outdoor views when abroad, based on my interests and location, so I can experience unique local sights.
    *   As a user, I want to upload a video with a caption at my current location so others nearby can see it.
    *   As a user, I want to see a map displaying content uploaded by others in my vicinity, categorized and tagged.
    *   As a user, I want to rate content with 1-5 stars before proceeding to view the next piece of content, to ensure content quality.
    *   As a user, I want to receive a push notification, email, or SMS when new content is uploaded within a geofenced area I'm interested in.
*   **Business Use Cases:**
    *   As a business, I want to send location-based advertisements to users within a specific geofenced area, based on their preferences, availability, and location, to drive local engagement.
    *   As a restaurant owner, I want to send out real-time "flash deals" within a mile radius to fill last-minute seats, to optimize my business operations.
    *   As a business, I want to create location-based ads that are fun and useful for consumers, maintaining high standards.
