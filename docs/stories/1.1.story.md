# Story 1.1: User Authentication & Profiles

## Status: Draft

## Story

As a new user, I want to create an account using my email and password, so I can access the platform.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

*   Given I am on the registration screen, when I enter a valid email and password, then my account is created and I am logged in.
*   Given I am a logged-in user, when I navigate to my profile, then I can set a username and upload a profile picture.
*   Given I am a logged-in user, when I edit my profile, then I can select multiple interests from a predefined list.
*   Given I am a logged-in user, when I log out, then my session is terminated.
*   Given I am a returning user, when I enter my email and password, then I am logged in.

## Dev Technical Guidance

*   **Authentication:** Firebase Authentication will be used for user registration, login, and session management.
*   **User Profiles:** User profiles, interests, and followed users will be stored in Firestore (`collections/users/{userId}`).
*   **Profile Picture Storage:** User-uploaded profile pictures will be stored in Cloud Storage for Firebase.
*   **Backend Logic:** Cloud Functions for Firebase (Node.js 22) will handle server-side logic for user management, profile updates, and data validation.
*   **Security Rules:** Firebase Security Rules must be configured for fine-grained access control to user data in Firestore and Cloud Storage.
*   **Frontend:** React/Next.js for the web PWA client, integrating Firebase SDKs for Auth, Firestore, and Storage.
*   **UI/UX:** Refer to UX/UI Specification for splash/onboarding screen, profile screen, and general theming (dark theme with vibrant accents).

## Tasks / Subtasks

1.  Implement user registration flow using Firebase Authentication. - **COMPLETED & VERIFIED (2025-05-26):** Successfully implemented and tested user registration with provided credentials.
2.  Implement user login/logout flow using Firebase Authentication.
3.  Develop user profile screen to display and edit user information.
4.  Integrate Firebase Firestore to store user profile data (username, interests).
5.  Integrate Firebase Cloud Storage for profile picture uploads.
6.  Implement logic for selecting multiple interests from a predefined list.
7.  Ensure Firebase Security Rules are correctly configured for user data.
8.  Implement session management and persistence.

## Project Structure Notes

*   New files for authentication components (e.g., `src/components/Auth/RegisterForm.js`, `src/components/Auth/LoginForm.js`).
*   New files for profile management (e.g., `src/components/Profile/ProfilePage.js`, `src/components/Profile/EditProfileForm.js`).
*   Firebase configuration files (e.g., `src/firebaseConfig.js`).
*   Cloud Functions for user-related backend logic (e.g., `functions/src/users.js`).

## Deviation Analysis

No significant deviations from the original epic-defined scope were identified. The detailed technical guidance and tasks further elaborate on the implementation details consistent with the project's architectural and technical preferences.
