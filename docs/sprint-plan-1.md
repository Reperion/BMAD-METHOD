# Sprint Plan 1: User Authentication & Profiles

## 1. Sprint Goal
To enable users to securely create accounts, log in, manage their basic profiles (username, profile picture, interests), and ensure their sessions are properly managed. This sprint establishes the foundational user management system for the platform.

## 2. Selected User Stories
*   **Story 1.1: User Authentication & Profiles**
    *   As a new user, I want to create an account using my email and password, so I can access the platform.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Given I am on the registration screen, when I enter a valid email and password, then my account is created and I am logged in.
        *   Given I am a logged-in user, when I navigate to my profile, then I can set a username and upload a profile picture.
        *   Given I am a logged-in user, when I edit my profile, then I can select multiple interests from a predefined list.
        *   Given I am a logged-in user, when I log out, then my session is terminated.
        *   Given I am a returning user, when I enter my email and password, then I am logged in.

## 3. Initial Tasks (from Story 1.1)
The following tasks are derived directly from Story 1.1's "Tasks / Subtasks" section:

1.  Implement user registration flow using Firebase Authentication.
2.  Implement user login/logout flow using Firebase Authentication.
3.  Develop user profile screen to display and edit user information.
4.  Integrate Firebase Firestore to store user profile data (username, interests).
5.  Integrate Firebase Cloud Storage for profile picture uploads.
6.  Implement logic for selecting multiple interests from a predefined list.
7.  Ensure Firebase Security Rules are correctly configured for user data.
8.  Implement session management and persistence.

## 4. Dependencies & Considerations
*   **Firebase Project Setup:** Requires a Firebase project with Authentication, Firestore, and Cloud Storage enabled.
*   **Development Environment:** Developers must have Node.js, Firebase CLI, and recommended VS Code extensions set up as per `docs/devops-setup.md`.
*   **Security Rules:** Close collaboration with the Architect/Security team to ensure robust Firebase Security Rules.
*   **UI/UX:** Adherence to `docs/ux-ui-spec.md` for design elements related to authentication and profile screens.

## 5. Definition of Done (DoD) for Sprint 1
*   All Acceptance Criteria for Story 1.1 are met.
*   All code is reviewed and merged into the main branch.
*   Unit and integration tests are written and passing.
*   Firebase Security Rules are implemented and tested for user data.
*   Basic logging and monitoring are in place for the implemented features.
*   Features are deployed to a staging environment and verified.

## 6. Next Steps (Post-Sprint Planning)
*   Development team begins work on tasks.
*   Daily Scrum meetings to track progress and address impediments.
*   Product Owner continues backlog refinement for subsequent stories.
*   Scrum Master facilitates daily scrums and removes impediments.
