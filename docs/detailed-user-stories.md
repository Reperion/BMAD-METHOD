# Detailed User Stories: Location-Based Content Platform (MVP)

This document contains refined user stories for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the Location-Based Content Platform, **which will be delivered primarily as a Progressive Web App (PWA)**. These stories are derived from the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and refined through collaboration between the Product Owner, Architect, and Scrum Master.

## 1. Core User & Map Experience

### 1.1. User Authentication & Profiles

*   **User Story:** As a new user, I want to create an account using my email and password, so I can access the platform.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Given I am on the registration screen, when I enter a valid email and password, then my account is created and I am logged in.
        *   Given I am a logged-in user, when I navigate to my profile, then I can set a username and upload a profile picture.
        *   Given I am a logged-in user, when I edit my profile, then I can select multiple interests from a predefined list.
        *   Given I am a logged-in user, when I log out, then my session is terminated.
        *   Given I am a returning user, when I enter my email and password, then I am logged in.

### 1.2. Accurate GPS Location Acquisition & Display on Mapbox Map

*   **User Story:** As a user, I want to see my current location accurately displayed on an interactive map, and view nearby content markers, so I can understand my surroundings and discover local content.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Given I have granted location permissions, when I open the app, then my current GPS location is displayed on the Mapbox map.
        *   Given I am viewing the map, when I pan and zoom, then the map updates smoothly.
        *   Given there is content near my current location, when I view the map, then relevant content markers are displayed on the map.
        *   Given I am a high-tier user, when my location changes, then my location on the map updates approximately every 10 seconds.

## 1.3. Content Upload (Text/Image/Video)

*   **User Story:** As a user, I want to upload text, images, or videos with automatic location tagging, and add categories/tags, so I can share my experiences tied to specific places.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Given I am on the content upload screen, when I select a media type (text, image, or video), then I can input/select the content.
        *   Given I have granted location permissions, when I upload content, then my current GPS location is automatically associated with the content.
        *   Given I am uploading content, when I input text for a caption, then the text is saved with the content.
        *   Given I am uploading content, when I select from predefined categories and/or add custom tags, then these are associated with my content.
        *   Given I have uploaded content, then it appears on the map for others to discover.

## 1.4. Mandatory 1-5 Star Voting System

*   **User Story:** As a user browsing content, I want to rate each piece of content with 1-5 stars, so I can provide feedback and proceed to discover more content.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Given I am viewing a piece of content, when the content is displayed, then a prominent 1-5 star rating interface is presented.
        *   Given I am viewing content, when I select a star rating, then my rating is recorded.
        *   Given I have rated content, then the system automatically presents the next piece of filtered content or allows me to close the current content view.
        *   Given I have rated content, then my rating contributes to the overall quality score of that content.

## 2. Next Steps for Backlog Refinement

This is an ongoing process of detailed user story breakdown. Subsequent refinement sessions will focus on the remaining "Must-have" MVP features from the PRD, including:

*   Content Filtering by Categories/Tags (further refinement)
*   Geofencing & Notifications (Define custom geofenced areas, PC-based interface, Push/Email/SMS notifications)
*   Business/Advertising Features (Location-Based Ad Creation, Targeted Advertising, Flash Deals)
*   Social Interaction (Likes/Reactions, Comments, Basic Following/Follower Functionality)
