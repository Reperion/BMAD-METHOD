# Architecture Design Document: Location-Based Content Platform

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the high-level architecture for the Location-Based Content Platform, focusing on key components, data flow, and technology choices, with a strong emphasis on Firebase Studio and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services. **The platform will be delivered primarily as a Progressive Web App (PWA)**, supporting location-based content, Mapbox integration, geofencing, push notifications (web, Android, iOS), email/SMS notifications, a dark-themed UI, a unique mandatory voting system, and real-time social interactions.

## 3. Core Components (Firebase/GCP Focus)

### 3.1. Mobile/Web Clients
*   **Description:** User-facing applications (iOS, Android, Web) for content upload, discovery, interaction, and mandatory voting. The web client will also support PC-based geofence drawing.
*   **Key Technologies:** React Native (for mobile), React/Next.js (for web). Firebase SDKs for Auth, Firestore, Storage, FCM. Mapbox SDKs for interactive maps (supporting multipolygon and radius drawing).
*   **Push Notifications:**
    *   **Web:** Web Push Notifications via Service Workers (requires user permission).
    *   **Mobile (Android/iOS):** Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for native app push notifications. Note: Native push notifications require a native application or a Progressive Web App (PWA) that registers a service worker. They cannot be sent to a device without some form of app installation/registration.
*   **Theming:** Implement a dark theme with vibrant accents using client-side theming libraries.

### 3.2. Firebase Authentication
*   **Description:** Manages user registration, login, and session management.
*   **Key Features:** Supports email/password, social logins. Integrates seamlessly with other Firebase services.

### 3.3. Cloud Functions for Firebase (Node.js 22)
*   **Description:** Serverless backend logic for API endpoints, data processing, and integrations. All backend logic will primarily reside here.
*   **Key Technologies:** Node.js 22 runtime. Used for:
    *   Content upload processing (e.g., media transcoding, metadata extraction).
    *   Content retrieval and filtering based on location and user preferences.
    *   Geofencing logic and trigger handling.
    *   Integration with Mapbox and external services.
    *   Handling the mandatory voting system logic.
    *   Managing social interactions (likes, comments, shares, following).

### 3.4. Firestore Database
*   **Description:** NoSQL document database for storing user profiles, content metadata, voting data, categories, tags, social interaction data (likes, comments, followers), and other application data.
*   **Key Features:** Real-time synchronization, offline support, scalable. Crucial for real-time social features.
*   **Geospatial Queries:** Can be used for basic proximity queries, or integrated with a dedicated geospatial solution for complex geofencing.

### 3.5. Cloud Storage for Firebase
*   **Description:** Scalable object storage for user-uploaded media files (images, videos).
*   **Key Features:** Secure, integrates with Firebase Auth for access control.

### 3.6. Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
*   **Description:** Cross-platform messaging solution for push notifications (web, Android, iOS).
*   **Key Features:** Reliable delivery, topic messaging, device group messaging. Triggered by Cloud Functions.

### 3.7. Cloud Pub/Sub
*   **Description:** Asynchronous messaging service for event-driven architectures.
*   **Use Case:** Used for triggering background Cloud Functions (e.g., after content upload, after a geofence event, new comment) to process data or send notifications.

### 3.8. Email/SMS Provider
*   **Description:** Third-party service for sending transactional emails and SMS messages.
*   **Key Technologies:** Twilio (suggested), SendGrid, Mailgun, or similar. Integrated via Cloud Functions.

### 3.9. Geospatial Service (Custom/External)
*   **Description:** Dedicated service for complex geospatial operations like precise geofencing, complex polygon queries, and spatial indexing.
*   **Key Technologies:** Could be a custom Cloud Function leveraging a specialized library, or an external service.
*   **Geospatial Database:** For complex geospatial data, consider PostGIS on Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL) or a dedicated geospatial solution integrated with Firestore.

### 3.10. Mapbox API
*   **Description:** Provides mapping capabilities, including base maps, geocoding, and custom styling. Supports drawing tools for geofences (multipolygon, radius).
*   **Integration:** Used by both clients and potentially Cloud Functions for server-side map operations.

### 3.11. Algolia/Elasticsearch (for advanced search/filtering)
*   **Description:** For highly performant and flexible content search and filtering based on tags, categories, usernames, and other attributes, especially when combined with location.
*   **Integration:** Data from Firestore would be synced to this service.

## 4. Data Flow (Example: Content Upload with Voting & Social)
1.  User captures content and location on Mobile/Web Client.
2.  Client uploads media to Cloud Storage and metadata (including GPS) to Firestore.
3.  Cloud Function (triggered by Firestore write) processes content, performs initial validation.
4.  Cloud Function publishes a message to Cloud Pub/Sub (e.g., "new_content_uploaded").
5.  Background Cloud Function (triggered by Pub/Sub) processes location data, updates Geospatial Database, and checks for geofence triggers.
6.  If geofence triggered, Cloud Function sends messages via FCM (for push), or triggers Email/SMS Provider for relevant users.
7.  When a user browses content, Cloud Functions retrieve content from Firestore/Algolia, filtered by location and user preferences.
8.  User views content and *must* submit a 1-5 star rating via a Cloud Function call.
9.  Rating is stored in Firestore, and the next piece of filtered content is served.
10. User performs social actions (like, comment, share, follow): Client sends request to Cloud Function, which updates Firestore. Real-time updates are pushed to relevant users via Firestore's real-time capabilities or FCM.

## 5. Key Architectural Considerations

### 5.1. Scalability
*   Firebase services (Auth, Firestore, Cloud Functions, Storage, FCM) are inherently scalable.
*   Leverage Cloud Functions for event-driven, auto-scaling backend logic.
*   Consider Algolia/Elasticsearch for scalable search.

### 5.2. Performance
*   Real-time capabilities of Firestore for content updates and social interactions (likes, comments, follower counts).
*   Optimized geospatial queries for location-based filtering.
*   CDN capabilities of Cloud Storage for media delivery.

### 5.3. Security
*   Firebase Security Rules for fine-grained access control to Firestore and Cloud Storage.
*   Firebase Authentication for user management.
*   Secure handling of user location data and privacy.

### 5.4. Content Quality (Mandatory Voting System)
*   Firestore will store content and associated ratings.
*   Cloud Functions will enforce the mandatory voting logic before serving subsequent content.
*   Content ranking algorithms can be implemented in Cloud Functions based on aggregated ratings.

### 5.5. Geofencing
*   Unified client-side drawing using Mapbox API.
*   For simple circular geofences, Firestore's geo-queries might suffice. For complex polygons or high-volume checks, a dedicated geospatial service (e.g., PostGIS on Cloud SQL) is recommended.

### 5.6. Push Notifications (Web, Android, iOS) & Email/SMS
*   FCM for push notifications (Web, Android, iOS native apps/PWAs).
*   Twilio or similar for Email/SMS, integrated via Cloud Functions.

### 5.7. Real-time Social Interactions (Twitter-like)
*   Firestore's real-time capabilities are well-suited for likes, comments, and follower updates.
*   Cloud Functions will handle the logic for these interactions and update Firestore.

## 6. Technology Stack (Proposed)
*   **Cloud Platform:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP) / Firebase Studio
*   **Backend Logic:** Cloud Functions for Firebase (Node.js 22)
*   **Databases:** Firestore (primary for real-time data, social interactions, content metadata), Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL with PostGIS for advanced geospatial), Redis (for caching if needed).
*   **Object Storage:** Cloud Storage for Firebase
*   **Messaging:** Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), Cloud Pub/Sub, Twilio (or similar for Email/SMS)
*   **Mapping:** Mapbox
*   **Search:** Algolia or Elasticsearch (managed service on GCP)
*   **Frontend:** React Native (mobile), React/Next.js (web)

## 7. Deployment Strategy
*   Serverless deployment model leveraging Firebase and Cloud Functions.
*   CI/CD pipelines for Cloud Functions and client applications.
*   Monitoring and logging via Firebase/GCP tools (Cloud Monitoring, Cloud Logging).
