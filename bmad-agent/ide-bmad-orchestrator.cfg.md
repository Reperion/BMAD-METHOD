# Configuration for IDE Agents

## Data Resolution

agent-root: (project-root)/bmad-agent
checklists: (agent-root)/checklists
data: (agent-root)/data
personas: (agent-root)/personas
tasks: (agent-root)/tasks
templates: (agent-root)/templates

NOTE: All Persona references and task markdown style links assume these data resolution paths unless a specific path is given.
Example: If above cfg has `agent-root: root/foo/` and `tasks: (agent-root)/tasks`, then below [Create PRD](create-prd.md) would resolve to `root/foo/tasks/create-prd.md`
